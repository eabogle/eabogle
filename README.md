Hello, and welcome to my GitHub! My name is Emily Bogle and I am a Math Ph.D. student (starting year 2) at Portland State University. 

Currently, my primary area of focus is numerical optimization, and I will have more specific things to say about that soon. Some topics I have enjoyed being exposed to so far is [Tikhonov Regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression) for image restoration/deblurring, estimating space-distributed source parameters (forcing term) in a nonlinear dynamical system, the [method of Lagrange Multipliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier). 

Some other areas I have studied and enjoyed recently are numerical methods, real analysis, and multilevel methods. 

My favorite function right now is the [Rosenbrock Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function) (see profile picture). 

The languages I use (on and off) the most right now are Python (2 years - currently) and MATLAB (1 year - currently), and I am familiar with C++ (1 year - the last year 2022) and R (3 years - the last year 2022). I would consider myself to have intermediate-level knowledge of these languages.
