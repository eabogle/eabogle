# Emily Bogle's GitHub

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub! I’m Emily Bogle, a fourth-year Mathematics Ph.D. student at Portland State University with a focus on applied mathematics.

My primary research involves analyzing partial differential equations on metric/quantum graphs, with a focus on eigenvector localization phenomena. I’m fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Jeffrey Ovall](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/jeffovall/home)  and [Dr. Hannah Kravitz](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/hkravitz) in this work.

Beyond my research, I have formal training and experience in numerical methods, optimization, numerical analysis, and machine learning (surrogate modeling). I primarily work in Python, and have experience with MATLAB and some formal training in C++. I'm currently expanding my skill set by learning Julia.
