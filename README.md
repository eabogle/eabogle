# Emily Bogle's GitHub

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub! My name is Emily Bogle and I am a third year Math Ph.D. student at Portland State University focusing mainly on applied math. 

My primary reserach includes analyzing partial differential equations on metric graphs. Under the advising of [Dr. Jeffrey Ovall](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/jeffovall/home) and [Dr. Hannah Kravitz](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/hkravitz) we are primarily researching eigenvector localization on metric graphs. 

Other areas of interest, formal training, and experience I have include [numerical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization), [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), and [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis). 

Some of my favorite benchmark test functions to optimize include [Rosenbrock](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/rosen.html), [Ackley](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/ackley.html), [Holder Table](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/holder.html), and [Griewank](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/griewank.html).

I mainly work in Python, but have some formal traning in C++ and experience in MATLAB. I am currently learning Julia with optimization uses in mind.
